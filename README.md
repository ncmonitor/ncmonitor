# About Me

My name is Mason Matrazzo, and I am currently based out of Auburn, Alabama. I recently graduated with a bachleor's degree in Wireless Engineering, and am currently pursing a PhD in Electrical Engineering. 

I possess a strong passion for all things related to RF and telecommunication. The genesis of these interests can be traced back to when my grandfather demonstrated how his antique shortwave radio could receive broadcasts from around the globe. For my tenth birthday, my parents bought me my own shortwave receiver, setting in motion a life-long love of RF. At the age of 13, I obtained my amateur radio license and was soon on the air communicating with operators around the world on the HF bands. The amateur radio hobby has presented me with innumerable incredible opportunities ranging from operating from Iceland, Guatemala, and Curacao, to meeting with senators and congressmen in Washington D.C. regarding the Amateur Radio Parity Act.

In addition to my amateur radio hobby, I have spent much time researching, monitoring, and mapping out public safety and other VHF/UHF radio systems. In 2020, I also began delving into the world of cellular telecommunications. Over the years, I have spent countless hours on the road and on foot, recording real-world cellular coverage, transmitter locations, and other associated data for the crowdsourced Cellmapper project. To date, I have mapped tens of thousands of cells, manually located thousands of towers, and uploaded millions of data points to the project from my mapping across numerous states and countries. When I am not studying or engaging in my tech-related hobbies, I also enjoy hiking, photography, and traveling.

These aforementioned hobbies strongly influenced my decision to attend Auburn and major in Wireless Engineering. It has been enjoyable to combine my interests with my academics and more deeply understand and appreciate the subjects that have fascinated me since childhood.

## Remote Receiver Network

I currently operate a network of remote recievers of various types, and plan to add more in the future! Here is an overview of where my network is currently deployed:

- Lee County, AL (Location #1)
- Lee County, AL (Location #2)
- Montgomery County, AL
